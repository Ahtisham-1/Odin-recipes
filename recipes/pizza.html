      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a flattened,
        yeast-leavened wheat dough base, traditionally topped with savory tomato
        sauce, mozzarella cheese, and olive oil, then baked at high
        temperatures.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <h3>The Dough (Base)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose or bread flour works best.</li>
        <li><b>Yeast:</b> Active dry or instant yeast to make it rise.</li>
        <li><b>Warm Water:</b> Activates the yeast (aim for 40–43°C).</li>
        <li><b>Salt & Sugar:</b> Enhances flavor and helps the yeast react.</li>
        <li><b>Olive Oil:</b> Adds richness and helps with texture.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Sauce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Tomato Base:</b> Use crushed tomatoes, passata, or a simple tomato
          puree.
        </li>
        <li><b>Garlic:</b> Finely minced or sautéed for aroma.</li>
        <li><b>Herbs:</b> Dried oregano or Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Seasoning:</b> A pinch of salt, pepper, and sometimes a dash of
          sugar to balance acidity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Toppings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Cheese:</b> Mozzarella is the classic choice for its meltability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fresh Herbs:</b> Basil leaves (added after baking for the best
          flavor).
        </li>
        <li><b>Veggies:</b> Onions, bell peppers, or mushrooms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <h3>Prepare the Dough</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Proof the yeast:</b> Mix warm water (40–43°C), sugar, and yeast in
          a bowl. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy and
          bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mix:</b> Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir
          until a rough dough forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Knead:</b> Move the dough to a floured surface. Knead by hand for
          5–10 minutes until it is smooth, elastic, and bounces back when poked.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Let it Rise</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a damp cloth
          or plastic wrap.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let it sit in a warm spot for 1 to 2 hours (or until it has doubled in
          size).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Assemble the Pizza</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Preheat:</b> Set your oven to its highest setting (usually
          230°C–260°C / 450°F–500°F) at least 30 minutes before baking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Shape:</b> Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles.
          Stretch or roll it into your desired thickness.
        </li>
        <li><b>Layer:</b> Spread sauce, then add cheese and toppings.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Bake</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the pizza on a preheated baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li>
          Bake for 8–15 minutes until the crust is golden and cheese bubbly.
        </li>
      </ol>

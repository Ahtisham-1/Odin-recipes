      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Introducing our treasured family recipe for authentic Chicken Dum
        Biryani! Aromatic long-grain rice, perfectly layered over succulent
        chicken marinated in a blend of earthy, aromatic spices, garnished with
        caramelized onions and delicate strands of saffron. Each bite bursts
        with the vibrant flavors of India.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Basmati Rice</strong>-Long-grain basmati rice is traditionally
          used to make biryani. I prefer the Kohinoor brand extra-long grain
          basmati rice, which is easily available at Indian grocery stores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chicken</strong>-Traditionally, whole bone-in chicken pieces
          are used to make biryani. Here in the US, it can be tough to find a
          whole chicken that's properly cut for biryani. As a handy shortcut, I
          like to use a mix of bone-in drumsticks and boneless chicken thighs.
          This way, you still get those authentic flavors and tender, juicy
          meat!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Whole Spices</strong>-shahi jeera, bay leaves, star anise,
          cloves, and green cardamom pods. A classic combination of spices to
          infuse the rice with rich flavor. Read more about each of these spices
          in my Essential Indian Spice Guide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ground Spices</strong>-turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder,
          Biryani Masala. Garam masala can be used in a pinch in place of
          Biryani Masala.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yellow Onion</strong>-thinly sliced yellow onion caramelized
          in ghee makes for the signature Birista onions that are a must in the
          marinade as well as for topping. With a rich golden color, they add a
          sweet, caramelized flavor to complement all the spices. Although these
          onions are traditionally deep-fried I also have an air fryer fried
          onions recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ghee</strong> homemade ghee helps bring authentic taste and
          aromas to Biryani and I highly recommend using ghee instead of oil
          when making Biryani.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Herbs</strong>-fresh mint and cilantro add a perfect
          combination of herbs for cool, citrusy flavors and a pop of color.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps To Make Biryani</h2>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Marinate the Chicken/Meat:</strong> Combine chicken with
          yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, biryani
          masala, lemon juice, and salt. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes to
          overnight in the refrigerator.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soak the Rice:</strong>Wash 2 cups of basmati rice 3–4 times
          until the water runs clear. Soak in water for 20–30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare Fried Onions (Birista):</strong>Thinly slice 2–3 large
          onions and fry them in oil or ghee until golden brown and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare Saffron Milk:</strong> Soak a pinch of saffron strands
          in 2–3 tablespoons of warm milk.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cooking</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>Heat oil/ghee in a heavy-bottomed
          pot. Add whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, shahi
          jeera) and sauté. Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat
          for 10–15 minutes until the chicken is 90% cooked and the gravy is
          thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Parboil the Rice:</strong>In a large pot, boil water with
          whole spices and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70-80%
          done (should still have a slight bite). Drain immediately.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Layering and Dum Cooking</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Layer the Biryani:</strong>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot,
          spread the chicken gravy on the bottom. Add a layer of rice over it.
          Top with chopped mint leaves, coriander leaves, and fried onions.
          Repeat the layers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Garnish:</strong>Pour the saffron milk, a tablespoon of
          ghee, and (optionally) kewra or rose water on the final rice laye
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dum Cooking:</strong> Seal the pot tightly with a lid (and
          optional aluminum foil or wheat dough). Cook on low heat (dum) for
          15–20 minutes. For better results, place the pot on a hot tawa
          (griddle) to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>Turn off the heat and let the biryani
          rest for 10 minutes before opening the lid. Gently mix the rice and
          chicken, then serve hot with raita.
        </li>
